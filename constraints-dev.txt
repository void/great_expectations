# The pip resolver became more strict starting with version 20.3
# This constraints file is "a way to specify global (version) limits for packages"
# without specifying the install of these packages.
# See also: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#constraints-files
# We use it to place limits on certain packages to help the resolver come to a compatible configuration more quickly
# To install dev dependencies using the new pip resolver (recommended) please use the following syntax:
# `python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt -c constraints-dev.txt`

"""
A simple test to verify that `context.build_data_docs()` works as expected.

As indicated in issue #3772, calling `context.build_data_docs()` raised an unexpected exception
when Great Expectations was installed in a non-filesystem location (i.e. it failed when
GE was installed inside a zip file -which is a location allowed by PEP 273-).

Therefore, this test is intended to be run after installing GE inside a zip file and
then setting the appropriate PYTHONPATH env variable. If desired, this test can also be
run after installing GE in a normal filesystem location (i.e. a directory).

This test is OK if it finishes without raising an exception.

To make it easier to debug this test, it prints:
* The location of the GE library: to verify that we are testing the library that we want
* The version of the GE library: idem
* data_docs url: If everything works, this will be a url (e.g. starting with file://...)

0.13.0
-----------------
* INTRODUCING THE NEW MODULAR EXPECTATIONS API (Experimental): this release introduces a new way to create expectation logic in its own class, making it much easier to author and share expectations. ``Expectation`` and ``MetricProvider`` classes now work together to validate data and consolidate logic for all backends by function. See the how-to guides in our documentation for more information on how to use the new API.
* INTRODUCING THE NEW DATASOURCE API (Experimental): this release introduces a new way to connect to datasources providing much richer guarantees for discovering ("inferring") data assets and partitions. The new API replaces "BatchKwargs" and "BatchKwargsGenerators" with BatchDefinition and BatchSpec objects built from DataConnector classes. You can read about the new API in our docs.
* The Core Concepts section of our documentation has been updated with descriptions of the classes and concepts used in the new API; we will continue to update that section and welcome questions and improvements.
* BREAKING: Data Docs rendering is now handled in the new Modular Expectations, which means that any custom expectation rendering needs to be migrated to the new API to function in version 0.13.0.
* BREAKING: **Renamed** Datasource to LegacyDatasource and introduced the new Datasource class. Because most installations rely on one PandasDatasource, SqlAlchemyDatasource, or SparkDFDatasource, most users will not be affected. However, if you have implemented highly customized Datasource class inheriting from the base class, you may need to update your inheritance.
* BREAKING: The new Modular Expectations API will begin removing the ``parse_strings_as_datetimes`` and ``allow_cross_type_comparisons`` flags in expectations. Expectation Suites that use the flags will need to be updated to use the new Modular Expectations. In general, simply removing the flag will produce correct behavior; if you still want the exact same semantics, you should ensure your raw data already has typed datetime objects.
* **NOTE:** Both the new Datasource API and the new Modular Expectations API are *experimental* and will change somewhat during the next several point releases. We are extremely excited for your feedback while we iterate rapidly, and continue to welcome new community contributions.

0.12.0
-----------------
* [BREAKING] This release includes a breaking change that *only* affects users who directly call `add_expectation`, `remove_expectation`, or `find_expectations`. (Most users do not use these APIs but add Expectations by stating them directly on Datasets). Those methods have been updated to take an ExpectationConfiguration object and `match_type` object. The change provides more flexibility in determining which expectations should be modified and allows us provide substantially improved support for two major features that we have frequently heard requested: conditional Expectations and more flexible multi-column custom expectations. See :ref:`expectation_suite_operations` and :ref:`migrating_versions` for more information.
* [FEATURE] Add support for conditional expectations using pandas execution engine (#1217 HUGE thanks @arsenii!)
* [FEATURE] ValidationActions can now consume and return "payload", which can be used to share information across ValidationActions
* [FEATURE] Add support for nested columns in the PySpark expectations (thanks @bramelfrink)!
* [FEATURE] add support for `expect_column_values_to_be_increasing` to `Spark` (thanks @mikaylaedwards)!
* [FEATURE] add support for `expect_column_values_to_be_decreasing` to `Spark` (thanks @mikaylaedwards)!
* [FEATURE] Slack Messages sent as ValidationActions now have link to DataDocs, if available.
* [FEATURE] Expectations now define “domain,” “success,” and “runtime” kwargs to allow them to determine expectation equivalence for updating expectations. Fixes column pair expectation update logic.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add a `skip_and_clean_missing` flag to `DefaultSiteIndexBuilder.build` (default True). If True, when an index page is being built and an existing HTML page does not have corresponding source data (i.e. an expectation suite or validation result was removed from source store), the HTML page is automatically deleted and will not appear in the index. This ensures that the expectations store and validations store are the source of truth for Data Docs.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Include datetime and bool column types in descriptive documentation results
* [ENHANCEMENT] Improve data docs page breadcrumbs to have clearer run information
* [ENHANCEMENT] Data Docs Validation Results only shows unexpected value counts if all unexpected values are available

0.9.0
-----------------

Version 0.9.0 is a major update to Great Expectations! The DataContext has continued to evolve into a powerful tool
for ensuring that Expectation Suites can properly represent the way users think about their data, and upgrading will
make it much easier to store and share expectation suites, and to build data docs that support your whole team.
You’ll get awesome new features including improvements to data docs look and the ability to choose and store metrics
for building flexible data quality dashboards.

The changes for version 0.9.0 fall into several broad areas:

1. Onboarding

Release 0.9.0 of Great Expectations makes it much easier to get started with the project. The `init` flow has grown
to support a much wider array of use cases and to use more natural language rather than introducing
GreatExpectations concepts earlier. You can more easily configure different backends and datasources, take advantage
of guided walkthroughs to find and profile data, and share project configurations with colleagues.

If you have already completed the `init` flow using a previous version of Great Expectations, you do not need to
rerun the command. However, **there are some small changes to your configuration that will be required**. See
:ref:`migrating_versions` for details.

2. CLI Command Improvements

With this release we have introduced a consistent naming pattern for accessing subcommands based on the noun (a
Great Expectations object like `suite` or `docs`) and verb (an action like `edit` or `new`). The new user experience
will allow us to more naturally organize access to CLI tools as new functionality is added.

3. Expectation Suite Naming and Namespace Changes

Defining shared expectation suites and validating data from different sources is much easier in this release. The
DataContext, which manages storage and configuration of expectations, validations, profiling, and data docs, no
longer requires that expectation suites live in a datasource-specific “namespace.” Instead, you should name suites
with the logical name corresponding to your data, making it easy to share them or validate against different data
sources. For example, the expectation suite "npi" for National Provider Identifier data can now be shared across
teams who access the same logical data in local systems using Pandas, on a distributed Spark cluster, or via a
relational database.

Batch Kwargs, or instructions for a datasource to build a batch of data, are similarly freed from a required
namespace, and you can more easily integrate Great Expectations into workflows where you do not need to use a
BatchKwargsGenerator (usually because you have a batch of data ready to validate, such as in a table or a known
directory).

The most noticeable impact of this API change is in the complete removal of the DataAssetIdentifier class. For
example, the `create_expectation_suite` and `get_batch` methods now no longer require a data_asset_name parameter,
relying only on the expectation_suite_name and batch_kwargs to do their job. Similarly, there is no more asset name
normalization required. See the upgrade guide for more information.

4. Metrics and Evaluation Parameter Stores

Metrics have received much more love in this release of Great Expectations! We've improved the system for declaring
evaluation parameters that support dependencies between different expectation suites, so you can easily identify a
particular field in the result of one expectation to use as the input into another. And the MetricsStore is now much
more flexible, supporting a new ValidationAction that makes it possible to select metrics from a validation result
to be saved in a database where they can power a dashboard.

5. Internal Type Changes and Improvements

Finally, in this release, we have done a lot of work under the hood to make things more robust, including updating
all of the internal objects to be more strongly typed. That change, while largely invisible to end users, paves the
way for some really exciting opportunities for extending Great Expectations as we build a bigger community around
the project.


We are really excited about this release, and encourage you to upgrade right away to take advantage of the more
flexible naming and simpler API for creating, accessing, and sharing your expectations. As always feel free to join
us on Slack for questions you don't see addressed!

  to this expectation
* Add support for checking backend type information for datetime columns using expect_column_min_to_be_between and
  expect_column_max_to_be_between

0.8.5
-----------------
* BREAKING CHANGE: move all reader options from the top-level batch_kwargs object to a sub-dictionary called
  "reader_options" for SparkDFDatasource and PandasDatasource. This means it is no longer possible to specify
  supplemental reader-specific options at the top-level of `get_batch`,  `yield_batch_kwargs` or `build_batch_kwargs`
  calls, and instead, you must explicitly specify that they are reader_options, e.g. by a call such as:
  `context.yield_batch_kwargs(data_asset_name, reader_options={'encoding': 'utf-8'})`.
* BREAKING CHANGE: move all query_params from the top-level batch_kwargs object to a sub-dictionary called
  "query_params" for SqlAlchemyDatasource. This means it is no longer possible to specify supplemental query_params at
  the top-level of `get_batch`,  `yield_batch_kwargs` or `build_batch_kwargs`
  calls, and instead, you must explicitly specify that they are query_params, e.g. by a call such as:
  `context.yield_batch_kwargs(data_asset_name, query_params={'schema': 'foo'})`.
* Add support for filtering validation result suites and validation result pages to show only failed expectations in
  generated documentation
* Add support for limit parameter to batch_kwargs for all datasources: Pandas, SqlAlchemy, and SparkDF; add support
  to generators to support building batch_kwargs with limits specified.
* Include raw_query and query_params in query_generator batch_kwargs
* Rename generator keyword arguments from data_asset_name to generator_asset to avoid ambiguity with normalized names
* Consistently migrate timestamp from batch_kwargs to batch_id

  relevant files.
* Add support for allow_relative_error on internal dataset quantile functions, and add support for
  build_continuous_partition_object in Redshift
* Fix truncated scroll bars in value_counts graphs


0.8.4.post0
----------------

  locations.


0.8.4
-----------------
* Improved the tutorials that walk new users through the process of creating expectations and validating data
* Changed the flow of the init command - now it creates the scaffolding of the project and adds a datasource. After
  that users can choose their path.
* Added a component with links to useful tutorials to the index page of the Data Docs website
* Improved the UX of adding a SQL datasource in the CLI - now the CLI asks for specific credentials for Postgres,
  MySQL, Redshift and Snowflake, allows continuing debugging in the config file and has better error messages
* Added batch_kwargs information to DataDocs validation results
* Fix an issue affecting file stores on Windows


0.8.3
-----------------
* Fix a bug in data-docs' rendering of mostly parameter
* Correct wording for expect_column_proportion_of_unique_values_to_be_between

0.8.0
-----------------

Version 0.8.0 is a significant update to Great Expectations, with many improvements focused on configurability
and usability.  See the :ref:`migrating_versions` guide for more details on specific changes, which include
several breaking changes to configs and APIs.

Highlights include:

1. Validation Operators and Actions. Validation operators make it easy to integrate GE into a variety of pipeline runners. They
   offer one-line integration that emphasizes configurability. See the :ref:`validation_operators_and_actions`
   feature guide for more information.

   - The DataContext `get_batch` method no longer treats `expectation_suite_name` or `batch_kwargs` as optional; they
     must be explicitly specified.
   - The top-level GE validate method allows more options for specifying the specific data_asset class to use.

2. First-class support for plugins in a DataContext, with several features that make it easier to configure and
   maintain DataContexts across common deployment patterns.

   - **Environments**: A DataContext can now manage :ref:`environment_and_secrets` more easily thanks to more dynamic and
     flexible variable substitution.
   - **Stores**: A new internal abstraction for DataContexts, :ref:`Stores <reference__core_concepts__data_context__stores>`, make extending GE easier by
     consolidating logic for reading and writing resources from a database, local, or cloud storage.
   - **Types**: Utilities configured in a DataContext are now referenced using `class_name` and `module_name` throughout
     the DataContext configuration, making it easier to extend or supplement pre-built resources. For now, the "type"
     parameter is still supported but expect it to be removed in a future release.

3. Partitioners: Batch Kwargs are clarified and enhanced to help easily reference well-known chunks of data using a
   partition_id. Batch ID and Batch Fingerprint help round out support for enhanced metadata around data
   assets that GE validates. See :ref:`Batch Identifiers <reference__core_concepts__batch_parameters>` for more information. The `GlobReaderBatchKwargsGenerator`,
   `QueryBatchKwargsGenerator`, `S3GlobReaderBatchKwargsGenerator`, `SubdirReaderBatchKwargsGenerator`, and `TableBatchKwargsGenerator` all support partition_id for
   easily accessing data assets.

4. Other Improvements:

   - We're beginning a long process of some under-the-covers refactors designed to make GE more maintainable as we
     begin adding additional features.
   - Restructured documentation: our docs have a new structure and have been reorganized to provide space for more
     easily adding and accessing reference material. Stay tuned for additional detail.
   - The command build-documentation has been renamed build-docs and now by
     default opens the Data Docs in the users' browser.

0.7.0
------------

Version 0.7 of Great Expectations is HUGE. It introduces several major new features
and a large number of improvements, including breaking API changes.

The core vocabulary of expectations remains consistent. Upgrading to
the new version of GE will primarily require changes to code that
uses data contexts; existing expectation suites will require only changes
to top-level names.

 * Major update of Data Contexts. Data Contexts now offer significantly \
   more support for building and maintaining expectation suites and \
   interacting with existing pipeline systems, including providing a namespace for objects.\
   They can handle integrating, registering, and storing validation results, and
   provide a namespace for data assets, making **batches** first-class citizens in GE.
   Read more: :ref:`data_context` or :py:mod:`great_expectations.data_context`

 * Major refactor of autoinspect. Autoinspect is now built around a module
   called "profile" which provides a class-based structure for building
   expectation suites. There is no longer a default  "autoinspect_func" --
   calling autoinspect requires explicitly passing the desired profiler. See :ref:`profiling`

 * New "Compile to Docs" feature produces beautiful documentation from expectations and expectation
   validation reports, helping keep teams on the same page.

 * Name clarifications: we've stopped using the overloaded terms "expectations
   config" and "config" and instead use "expectation suite" to refer to a
   collection (or suite!) of expectations that can be used for validating a
   data asset.

   - Expectation Suites include several top level keys that are useful \
     for organizing content in a data context: data_asset_name, \
     expectation_suite_name, and data_asset_type. When a data_asset is \
     validated, those keys will be placed in the `meta` key of the \
     validation result.

 * Major enhancement to the CLI tool including `init`, `render` and more flexibility with `validate`

 * Added helper notebooks to make it easy to get started. Each notebook acts as a combination of \
   tutorial and code scaffolding, to help you quickly learn best practices by applying them to \
   your own data.

 * Relaxed constraints on expectation parameter values, making it possible to declare many column
   aggregate expectations in a way that is always "vacuously" true, such as
   ``expect_column_values_to_be_between`` ``None`` and ``None``. This makes it possible to progressively
   tighten expectations while using them as the basis for profiling results and documentation.

  * Enabled caching on dataset objects by default.

 * Bugfixes and improvements:

   * New expectations:

     * expect_column_quantile_values_to_be_between
     * expect_column_distinct_values_to_be_in_set

   * Added support for ``head`` method on all current backends, returning a PandasDataset
   * More implemented expectations for SparkDF Dataset with optimizations

     * expect_column_values_to_be_between
     * expect_column_median_to_be_between
     * expect_column_value_lengths_to_be_between

   * Optimized histogram fetching for SqlalchemyDataset and SparkDFDataset
   * Added cross-platform internal partition method, paving path for improved profiling
   * Fixed bug with outputstrftime not being honored in PandasDataset
   * Fixed series naming for column value counts
   * Standardized naming for expect_column_values_to_be_of_type
   * Standardized and made explicit use of sample normalization in stdev calculation
   * Added from_dataset helper
   * Internal testing improvements
   * Documentation reorganization and improvements
   * Introduce custom exceptions for more detailed error logs

0.6.1
------------
* Re-add testing (and support) for py2

* Migrate distributional expectations to new testing framework
* Add support for two new expectations: expect_column_distinct_values_to_contain_set
  and expect_column_distinct_values_to_equal_set (thanks @RoyalTS)
* FUTURE BREAKING CHANGE: The new cache mechanism for Datasets, \
  when enabled, causes GE to assume that dataset does not change between evaluation of individual expectations. \
  We anticipate this will become the future default behavior.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Drop official support pandas < 0.22

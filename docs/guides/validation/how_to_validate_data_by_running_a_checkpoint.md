This guide will help you validate your data by running a Checkpoint.

As stated in the Getting Started Tutorial
[Validate your data using a Checkpoint](../../tutorials/getting_started/validate_your_data.md), the best way
to validate data in production with Great Expectations is using a [Checkpoint](../../reference/checkpoints_and_actions).
The advantage of using a [Checkpoint](../../reference/checkpoints_and_actions) is ease of use, due to its principal
capability of combining the existing configuration in order to set up and perform the validation:
- [Expectation Suites](../../reference/expectations/expectations)
- [DataConnectors](../../tutorials/getting_started/connect_to_data.md)
- [BatchRequests](../../reference/datasources#Batches)
- [Validation Actions](../../reference/checkpoints_and_actions.md)
 
Otherwise, configuring these validation parameters would have to be done via the API.  A
[Checkpoint](../../reference/checkpoints_and_actions) encapsulates this "boilerplate" and ensures that
all components work in harmony together.  Finally, running a configured
[Checkpoint](../../reference/checkpoints_and_actions) is a one-liner, as described below.

<Prerequisites>

- Configured a [Data Context](../../tutorials/getting_started/initialize_a_data_context.md).
- Configured an [Expectations Suite](../../tutorials/getting_started/create_your_first_expectations.md).
- Configured a [Checkpoint](./checkpoints/how_to_create_a_new_checkpoint)

</Prerequisites>

You can run the Checkpoint from the CLI in a Terminal shell or using Python.

  defaultValue='terminal'
  values={[
  {label: 'Terminal', value:'terminal'},
  {label: 'Python', value:'python'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="terminal">

Steps
-----

1. Checkpoints can be run like applications from the command line by running:

```bash
great_expectations --v3-api checkpoint run my_checkpoint
Validation failed!
```

2. Next, observe the output which will tell you if all validations passed or failed.

Additional notes
----------------

This command will return posix status codes and print messages as follows:

    +-------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------------+
    | **Situation**                 | **Return code** | **Message**           |
    +-------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------------+
    | all validations passed        | 0               | Validation succeeded! |
    +-------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------------+
    | one or more validation failed | 1               | Validation failed!    |
    +-------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------------+

Steps
-----

1. First, generate the Python script with the command:

```bash
great_expectations --v3-api checkpoint script my_checkpoint
```

2. Next, you will see a message about where the Python script was created like:

```bash
A Python script was created that runs the checkpoint named: `my_checkpoint`
  - The script is located in `great_expectations/uncommitted/run_my_checkpoint.py`
  - The script can be run with `python great_expectations/uncommitted/run_my_checkpoint.py`
```

3. Next, open the script -- it should look like this:

```python
"""
This is a basic generated Great Expectations script that runs a Checkpoint.

Checkpoints are the primary method for validating batches of data in production and triggering any followup actions.

A Checkpoint facilitates running a validation as well as configurable Actions such as updating Data Docs, sending a
notification to team members about Validation Results, or storing a result in a shared cloud storage.

Checkpoints can be run directly without this script using the `great_expectations checkpoint run` command.  This script
is provided for those who wish to run Checkpoints in Python.

Usage:
- Run this file: `python great_expectations/uncommitted/run_my_checkpoint.py`.
- This can be run manually or via a scheduler such, as cron.
- If your pipeline runner supports Python snippets, then you can paste this into your pipeline.
"""
import sys

from great_expectations.checkpoint.types.checkpoint_result import CheckpointResult
from great_expectations.data_context import DataContext

data_context: DataContext = DataContext(
    context_root_dir="/path/to/great_expectations"
)

result: CheckpointResult = data_context.run_checkpoint(
    checkpoint_name="my_checkpoint",
    batch_request=None,
    run_name=None,
)

if not result["success"]:
    print("Validation failed!")
    sys.exit(1)

print("Validation succeeded!")
sys.exit(0)
```

4. This Python script can then be invoked directly using Python:
```python
python great_expectations/uncommitted/run_my_checkpoint.py
```
Alternatively, the above Python code can be embedded in your pipeline.

## Additional Notes

- Other arguments to the `DataContext.run_checkpoint()` method may be required, depending on the amount and specifics of
the Checkpoint configuration previously saved in the configuration file of the Checkpoint with the corresponding `name`.
- The dynamically specified Checkpoint configuration, provided to the runtime as arguments to `DataContext.run_checkpoint()`
must complement the settings in the Checkpoint configuration file so as to comprise a properly and sufficiently
configured Checkpoint with the given `name`.
- Please see [How to configure a new Checkpoint using test_yaml_config](./checkpoints/how_to_configure_a_new_checkpoint_using_test_yaml_config.md) for more Checkpoint configuration examples (including the convenient templating mechanism) and `DataContext.run_checkpoint()` invocation options.

title: How to configure an Expectation store to use PostgreSQL
---
import Prerequisites from '../../connecting_to_your_data/components/prerequisites.jsx'

By default, newly profiled Expectations are stored in JSON format in the `expectations/` subdirectory of your `great_expectations/` folder.  This guide will help you configure Great Expectations to store them in a PostgreSQL database.

<Prerequisites>

- Configured a [Data Context](../../../tutorials/getting_started/initialize_a_data_context.md).
- Configured an [Expectations Suite](../../../tutorials/getting_started/create_your_first_expectations.md).
- Configured a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database with appropriate credentials.

</Prerequisites>


Steps
-----


1. **Configure the** `config_variables.yml` **file with your database credentials**

    We recommend that database credentials be stored in the `config_variables.yml` file, which is located in the `uncommitted/` folder by default, and is not part of source control. The following lines add database credentials under the key `db_creds`. Additional options for configuring the `config_variables.yml` file or additional environment variables can be found [here](../configuring_data_contexts/how_to_configure_credentials.md).

    ```yaml
    db_creds:
        drivername: postgres
        host: '<your_host_name>'
        port: '<your_port>'
        username: '<your_username>'
        password: '<your_password>'
        database: '<your_database_name>'
    ```


2. **Identify your Data Context Expectations Store**

    In your ``great_expectations.yml`` , look for the following lines.  The configuration tells Great Expectations to look for Expectations in a store called ``expectations_store``. The ``base_directory`` for ``expectations_store`` is set to ``expectations/`` by default.

    ```yaml
    expectations_store_name: expectations_store

    stores:
        expectations_store:
            class_name: ExpectationsStore
            store_backend:
                class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
                base_directory: expectations/
    ```


3. **Update your configuration file to include a new store for Expectations on PostgreSQL**

    In our case, the name is set to ``expectations_postgres_store``, but it can be any name you like.  We also need to make some changes to the ``store_backend`` settings.  The ``class_name`` will be set to ``DatabaseStoreBackend``, and ``credentials`` will be set to ``${db_creds}``, which references the corresponding key in the ``config_variables.yml`` file.

    ```yaml
    expectations_store_name: expectations_postgres_store

    stores:
        expectations_postgres_store:
            class_name: ExpectationsStore
            store_backend:
                class_name: DatabaseStoreBackend
                credentials: ${db_creds}
    ```


4. **Confirm that the new Expectations store has been added by running** ``great_expectations --v3-api store list``

    Notice the output contains two Expectation stores: the original ``expectations_store`` on the local filesystem and the ``expectations_postgres_store`` we just configured.  This is ok, since Great Expectations will look for Expectations in PostgreSQL as long as we set the ``expectations_store_name`` variable to ``expectations_postgres_store``, which we did in the previous step.  The config for ``expectations_store`` can be removed if you would like.

    ```bash
    great_expectations --v3-api store list

    - name: expectations_store
    class_name: ExpectationsStore
    store_backend:
        class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
        base_directory: expectations/

    - name: expectations_postgres_store
    class_name: ExpectationsStore
    store_backend:
        class_name: DatabaseStoreBackend
        credentials:
            database: '<your_db_name>'
            drivername: postgresql
            host: '<your_host_name>'
            password: ******
            port: '<your_port>'
            username: '<your_username>'
    ```


5. **Create a new Expectation Suite by running** ``great_expectations --v3-api suite new``

    This command prompts you to create and name a new Expectation Suite and to select a sample batch of data for the Suite to describe. Behind the scenes, Great Expectations will create a new table in your database called ``ge_expectations_store``, and populate the fields ``expectation_suite_name`` and ``value`` with information from the newly created Expectation Suite.

    If you follow the prompts and create an Expectation Suite called ``exp1``, you can expect to see output similar to the following :

    ```bash
    great_expectations --v3-api suite new

    #  ...

    Name the new Expectation Suite: exp1

    Great Expectations will choose a couple of columns and generate expectations about them
    to demonstrate some examples of assertions you can make about your data.

    Great Expectations will store these expectations in a new Expectation Suite 'exp1' here:

    postgresql://'<your_db_name>'/exp1

    #  ...
    ```


6. **Confirm that Expectations can be accessed from PostgreSQL by running** ``great_expectations --v3-api suite list``

    The output should include the Expectation Suite we created in the previous step: ``exp1``.

    ```bash
    great_expectations --v3-api suite list

    1 Expectation Suites found:
     - exp1
    ```

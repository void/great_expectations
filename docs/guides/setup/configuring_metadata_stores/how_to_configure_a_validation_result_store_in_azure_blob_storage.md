title: How to configure a Validation Result store in Azure Blob Storage
---
import Prerequisites from '../../connecting_to_your_data/components/prerequisites.jsx'

By default, Validations are stored in JSON format in the ``uncommitted/validations/`` subdirectory of your ``great_expectations/`` folder.  Since Validations may include examples of data (which could be sensitive or regulated) they should not be committed to a source control system. This guide will help you configure a new storage location for Validations in Azure Blob Storage.

<Prerequisites>

- Configured a [Data Context](../../../tutorials/getting_started/initialize_a_data_context.md).
- Configured an [Expectations Suite](../../../tutorials/getting_started/create_your_first_expectations.md).
- Configured a [Checkpoint](../../../tutorials/getting_started/validate_your_data.md).
- Configured an [Azure Storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage) and get the [connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal).
- Create the Azure Blob container. If you also wish to [host and share Data Docs on Azure Blob Storage](../../../guides/setup/configuring_data_docs/how_to_host_and_share_data_docs_on_azure_blob_storage.md) then you may setup this first and then use the ``$web`` existing container to store your expectations.
- Identify the prefix (folder) where Validations will be stored (you don't need to create the folder, the prefix is just part of the Blob name).

Steps
-----

1. **Configure the** ``config_variables.yml`` **file with your Azure Storage credentials**

    We recommend that Azure Storage credentials be stored in the ``config_variables.yml`` file, which is located in the ``uncommitted/`` folder by default, and is not part of source control. The following lines add Azure Storage credentials under the key ``AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING``. Additional options for configuring the ``config_variables.yml`` file or additional environment variables can be found [here](../../setup/configuring_data_contexts/how_to_configure_credentials.md).

    ```yaml
    AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING: "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net;AccountName=<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-NAME>;AccountKey=<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-KEY==>"
    ```


2. **Identify your Data Context Validations Store**

    In your ``great_expectations.yml``, look for the following lines.  The configuration tells Great Expectations to look for Validations in a store called ``validations_store``. The ``base_directory`` for ``validations_store`` is set to ``uncommitted/validations/`` by default.

    ```yaml
    validations_store_name: validations_store

    stores:
        validations_store:
            class_name: ValidationsStore
            store_backend:
                class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
                base_directory: uncommitted/validations/
    ```


3. **Update your configuration file to include a new store for Validations on Azure Storage account**

    In our case, the name is set to ``validations_AZ_store``, but it can be any name you like.  We also need to make some changes to the ``store_backend`` settings.  The ``class_name`` will be set to ``TupleAzureBlobStoreBackend``,  ``container`` will be set to the name of your blob container (the equivalent of S3 bucket for Azure) you wish to store your validations, ``prefix`` will be set to the folder in the container where Validation files will be located, and ``connection_string`` will be set to ``${AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING}``, which references the corresponding key in the ``config_variables.yml`` file.

    ```yaml
    validations_store_name: validations_AZ_store

    stores:
        validations_AZ_store:
            class_name: ValidationsStore
            store_backend:
                class_name: TupleAzureBlobStoreBackend
                container: <blob-container>
                prefix: validations
                connection_string: ${AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING}
    ```

    :::note
    If the container is called ``$web`` (for [hosting and sharing Data Docs on Azure Blob Storage](../../setup/configuring_data_docs/how_to_host_and_share_data_docs_on_azure_blob_storage.md)) then set ``container: \$web`` so the escape char will allow us to reach the ``$web``container.
    :::

4. **Copy existing Validations JSON files to the Azure blob**. (This step is optional).

    One way to copy Validations into Azure Blob Storage is by using the ``az storage blob upload`` command, which is part of the Azure SDK. The following example will copy one Validation from a local folder to the Azure blob.   Information on other ways to copy Validation JSON files, like the Azure Storage browser in the Azure Portal, can be found in the [Documentation for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal).

    ```bash
    export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net;AccountName=<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-NAME>;AccountKey=<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-KEY==>"
    az storage blob upload -f <local/path/to/validation.json> -c <GREAT-EXPECTATION-DEDICATED-AZURE-BLOB-CONTAINER-NAME> -n <PREFIX>/<validation.json>
    example with a validation related to the exp1 expectation:
    az storage blob upload -f great_expectations/uncommitted/validations/exp1/20210306T104406.877327Z/20210306T104406.877327Z/8313fb37ca59375eb843adf388d4f882.json -c <blob-container> -n validations/exp1/20210306T104406.877327Z/20210306T104406.877327Z/8313fb37ca59375eb843adf388d4f882.json
    Finished[#############################################################]  100.0000%
    {
      "etag": "\"0x8D8E09F894650C7\"",
      "lastModified": "2021-03-06T12:58:28+00:00"
    }
    ```


5. **Confirm that the new Validations store has been added by running** ``great_expectations --v3-api store list``.

    Notice the output contains two Validation stores: the original ``validations_store`` on the local filesystem and the ``validations_AZ_store`` we just configured.  This is ok, since Great Expectations will look for Validations in Azure Blob as long as we set the ``validations_store_name`` variable to ``validations_AZ_store``, and the config for ``validations_store`` can be removed if you would like.

    ```bash
    great_expectations --v3-api store list

     - name: validations_store
       class_name: ValidationsStore
       store_backend:
         class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
         base_directory: uncommitted/validations/

     - name: validations_AZ_store
       class_name: ValidationsStore
       store_backend:
         class_name: TupleAzureBlobStoreBackend
         connection_string: "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net;AccountName=<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-NAME>;AccountKey=<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-KEY==>"
         container: <blob-container>
         prefix: validations
    ```


6. **Confirm that the Validations store has been correctly configured.**

    Run a [Checkpoint](../../../tutorials/getting_started/validate_your_data.md) to store results in the new Validations store on Azure Blob then visualize the results by re-building [Data Docs](../../../tutorials/getting_started/check_out_data_docs.md).

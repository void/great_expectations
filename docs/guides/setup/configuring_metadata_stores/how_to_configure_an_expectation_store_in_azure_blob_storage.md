title: How to configure an Expectation store to use Azure Blob Storage
---
import Prerequisites from '../../connecting_to_your_data/components/prerequisites.jsx'

By default, newly profiled Expectations are stored in JSON format in the ``expectations/`` subdirectory of your ``great_expectations/`` folder. This guide will help you configure Great Expectations to store them in Azure Blob Storage.

<Prerequisites>

- Configured a [Data Context](../../../tutorials/getting_started/initialize_a_data_context.md).
- Configured an [Expectations Suite](../../../tutorials/getting_started/create_your_first_expectations.md).
- Configured an [Azure Storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en_us/azure/storage) and get the [connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/en_us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal).
- Create the Azure Blob container. If you also wish to [host and share Data Docs on Azure Blob Storage](../configuring_data_docs/how_to_host_and_share_data_docs_on_azure_blob_storage.md) then you may setup this first and then use the ``$web`` existing container to store your expectations.
- Identify the prefix (folder) where Expectations will be stored (you don't need to create the folder, the prefix is just part of the Blob name).

Steps
-----

1. **Configure the** ``config_variables.yml`` **file with your Azure Storage credentials**

    We recommend that Azure Storage credentials be stored in the  ``config_variables.yml`` file, which is located in the ``uncommitted/`` folder by default, and is not part of source control.  The following lines add Azure Storage credentials under the key ``AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING``. Additional options for configuring the ``config_variables.yml`` file or additional environment variables can be found [here](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/guides/setup/configuring_data_contexts/how_to_configure_credentials_using_a_yaml_file_or_environment_variables).

    ```yaml
    AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING: "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net;AccountName=<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-NAME>;AccountKey=<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-KEY==>"
    ```


2. **Identify your Data Context Expectations Store**

    In your ``great_expectations.yml`` , look for the following lines.  The configuration tells Great Expectations to look for Expectations in a store called ``expectations_store``. The ``base_directory`` for ``expectations_store`` is set to ``expectations/`` by default.

    ```yaml
    expectations_store_name: expectations_store

    stores:
        expectations_store:
            class_name: ExpectationsStore
            store_backend:
                class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
                base_directory: expectations/
    ```


3. **Update your configuration file to include a new store for Expectations on Azure Storage account**

    In our case, the name is set to ``expectations_AZ_store``, but it can be any name you like.  We also need to make some changes to the ``store_backend`` settings.  The ``class_name`` will be set to ``TupleAzureBlobStoreBackend``,  ``container`` will be set to the name of your blob container (the equivalent of S3 bucket for Azure) you wish to store your expectations, ``prefix`` will be set to the folder in the container where Expectation files will be located, and ``connection_string`` will be set to ``${AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING}``, which references the corresponding key in the ``config_variables.yml`` file.

    ```yaml
    expectations_store_name: expectations_AZ_store

    stores:
        expectations_AZ_store:
            class_name: ExpectationsStore
            store_backend:
              class_name: TupleAzureBlobStoreBackend
              container: <blob-container>
              prefix: expectations
              connection_string: ${AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING}
    ```

    :::note
    If the container is called ``$web`` (for [hosting and sharing Data Docs on Azure Blob Storage](../configuring_data_docs/how_to_host_and_share_data_docs_on_azure_blob_storage.md)) then set ``container: \$web`` so the escape char will allow us to reach the ``$web``container.
    :::


4. **Copy existing Expectation JSON files to the Azure blob**. (This step is optional).

    One way to copy Expectations into Azure Blob Storage is by using the ``az storage blob upload`` command, which is part of the Azure SDK. The following example will copy one Expectation, ``exp1`` from a local folder to the Azure blob.   Information on other ways to copy Expectation JSON files, like the Azure Storage browser in the Azure Portal, can be found in the [Documentation for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en_us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal).

    ```bash
    export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net;AccountName=<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-NAME>;AccountKey=<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-KEY==>"
    az storage blob upload -f <local/path/to/expectation.json> -c <GREAT-EXPECTATION-DEDICATED-AZURE-BLOB-CONTAINER-NAME> -n <PREFIX>/<expectation.json>
    example :
    az storage blob upload -f great_expectations/expectations/exp1.json -c <blob-container> -n expectations/exp1.json

    Finished[#############################################################]  100.0000%
    {
    "etag": "\"0x8D8E08E5DA47F84\"",
    "lastModified": "2021-03-06T10:55:33+00:00"
    }
    ```


5. **Confirm that the new Expectations store has been added by running** ``great_expectations --v3-api store list``

    Notice the output contains two Expectation stores: the original ``expectations_store`` on the local filesystem and the ``expectations_AZ_store`` we just configured.  This is ok, since Great Expectations will look for Expectations in Azure Blob as long as we set the ``expectations_store_name`` variable to ``expectations_AZ_store``, which we did in the previous step.  The config for ``expectations_store`` can be removed if you would like.

    ```bash
    great_expectations --v3-api store list

     - name: expectations_store
       class_name: ExpectationsStore
       store_backend:
         class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
         base_directory: expectations/

     - name: expectations_AZ_store
       class_name: ExpectationsStore
       store_backend:
         class_name: TupleAzureBlobStoreBackend
         connection_string: DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net;AccountName=<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-NAME>;AccountKey=<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-KEY==>
         container: <blob-container>
         prefix: expectations
    ```


6. **Confirm that Expectations can be accessed from Azure Blob Storage by running** ``great_expectations --v3-api suite list``.

    If you followed Step 4, the output should include the Expectation we copied to Azure Blob: ``exp1``.  If you did not copy Expectations to the new Store, you will see a message saying no Expectations were found.

    ```bash
    great_expectations --v3-api suite list

    Using v2 (Batch Kwargs) API
    1 Expectation Suite found:
    - exp1
    ```

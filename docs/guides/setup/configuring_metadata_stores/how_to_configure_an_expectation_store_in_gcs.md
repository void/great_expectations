title: How to configure an Expectation store to use GCS

import Prerequisites from '../../connecting_to_your_data/components/prerequisites.jsx'

By default, newly profiled Expectations are stored in JSON format in the ``expectations/`` subdirectory of your ``great_expectations/`` folder.  This guide will help you configure Great Expectations to store them in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.

<Prerequisites>

- Configured a [Data Context](../../../tutorials/getting_started/initialize_a_data_context.md).
- Configured an [Expectations Suite](../../../tutorials/getting_started/create_your_first_expectations.md).
- Configured a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) with credentials that can access the appropriate GCP resources, which include Storage Objects.
- Identified the GCP project, GCS bucket, and prefix where Expectations will be stored.

</Prerequisites>

Steps
-----

1. **Configure your GCP credentials**

    Check that your environment is configured with the appropriate authentication credentials needed to connect to the GCS bucket where Expectations will be stored.

    The Google Cloud Platform documentation describes how to verify your [authentication for the Google Cloud API](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started), which includes:

    1. Creating a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account,
    2. Setting the ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` environment variable,
    3. Verifying authentication by running a simple [Google Cloud Storage client](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries) library script.

2. **Identify your Data Context Expectations Store**

    In your ``great_expectations.yml``, look for the following lines.  The configuration tells Great Expectations to look for Expectations in a store called ``expectations_store``. The ``base_directory`` for ``expectations_store`` is set to ``expectations/`` by default.

    ```yaml file=../../../../tests/integration/docusaurus/setup/configuring_metadata_stores/how_to_configure_an_expectation_store_in_gcs.py#L29-L36
    ```


3. **Update your configuration file to include a new store for Expectations on GCS**

    In our case, the name is set to ``expectations_GCS_store``, but it can be any name you like.  We also need to make some changes to the ``store_backend`` settings.  The ``class_name`` will be set to ``TupleGCSStoreBackend``, ``project`` will be set to your GCP project, ``bucket`` will be set to the address of your GCS bucket, and ``prefix`` will be set to the folder on GCS where Expectation files will be located.

    :::warning

    If you are also storing [Validations in GCS](./how_to_configure_a_validation_result_store_in_gcs.md) or [DataDocs in GCS](../configuring_data_docs/how_to_host_and_share_data_docs_on_gcs), please ensure that the ``prefix`` values are disjoint and one is not a substring of the other.

    ```yaml file=../../../../tests/integration/docusaurus/setup/configuring_metadata_stores/how_to_configure_an_expectation_store_in_gcs.py#L44-L53
    ```


4. **Copy existing Expectation JSON files to the GCS bucket**. (This step is optional).

    One way to copy Expectations into GCS is by using the ``gsutil cp`` command, which is part of the Google Cloud SDK. The following example will copy one Expectation, ``my_expectation_suite`` from a local folder to the GCS bucket. Information on other ways to copy Expectation JSON files, like the Cloud Storage browser in the Google Cloud Console, can be found in the [Documentation for Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uploading-objects).

    ```bash file=../../../../tests/integration/docusaurus/setup/configuring_metadata_stores/how_to_configure_an_expectation_store_in_gcs.py#L97
    ```
   
    ```bash file=../../../../tests/integration/docusaurus/setup/configuring_metadata_stores/how_to_configure_an_expectation_store_in_gcs.py#L128
    ```


5. **Confirm that the new Expectations store has been added by running:**

    ```bash file=../../../../tests/integration/docusaurus/setup/configuring_metadata_stores/how_to_configure_an_expectation_store_in_gcs.py#L135
    ```
   
    Only the active Stores will be listed. Great Expectations will look for Expectations in GCS as long as we set the ``expectations_store_name`` variable to ``expectations_GCS_store``, and the config for ``expectations_store`` can be removed if you would like.

    ```bash file=../../../../tests/integration/docusaurus/setup/configuring_metadata_stores/how_to_configure_an_expectation_store_in_gcs.py#L146-L152
    ```


6. **Confirm that Expectations can be accessed from GCS by running:**

    ```bash file=../../../../tests/integration/docusaurus/setup/configuring_metadata_stores/how_to_configure_an_expectation_store_in_gcs.py#L162
    ```

    If you followed Step 4, the output should include the Expectation we copied to GCS: ``my_expectation_suite``. If you did not copy Expectations to the new Store, you will see a message saying no Expectations were found.

    ```bash file=../../../../tests/integration/docusaurus/setup/configuring_metadata_stores/how_to_configure_an_expectation_store_in_gcs.py#L173-L174
    ```
